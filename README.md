# Video_processing_python

This repo contains the code for processing videos using python. The idea behind this technique is to convert the video into series of frames and then using those frames as an input to the neural network with a little preprocessing.

I have made my model using keras abstraction library that works over Tensorflow backend. I have also performed transfer learning for better and efficient results, using VGG16 as the base model. I was able to achieve a fair amount of accuracy.
